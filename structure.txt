This document explains the structure of Arek Window Manager. It documents the
various decisions made to get Mutter into a tiling window manager state, which
sometimes requires certain sub-optimal solutions. The upside of writing Arek
Window Manager as a Mutter plugin, however, is the simplicity of the approach.
The alternative would be to fork Mutter and hack its source directly, which is
considerably more complicated and time consuming.

Items in *asterisks* are not implemented, either because Mutter disallows them
currently (in which case these items are considered to-do if/when they are
supported) or because I simply haven't gotten there yet.

Window management
-----------------

In general, tiling window managers offer both normal, i.e. floating, window
management as well as tiling window management, which speaks for itself. Using
Mutter, the whole floating part is already taken care of. However, tiled
windows are usually on a separate "layer", below the floating windows. The
advantage of this approach is that floating windows never dissapear behind the
tiled windows, from which they would be hard to find and manage by the user.
Mutter has a layering system that Arek Window Manager takes advantage of. Sadly
this does not happen in the most elegant way, as *Mutter does not expose its
windows' "below" property so that tiled windows could be lowered into the
META_LAYER_BOTTOM layer*. Instead, tiled windows are kept in their default
layer (META_LAYER_NORMAL) while floating windows are placed in the
META_LAYER_TOP layer by setting their "above" property. Windows can be moved
between tiling and floating state simply by changing their layer: as soon as a
window's layer is changed, Arek Window Manager retiles the current workspace and
the required changes are made. A window can be toggled between tiling and
floating state by using the Super+Space keyboard shortcut or by dragging it away
from its tiled position. *If Mutter ever allows setting new
GDesktopTitlebarAction, middle clicking on the titlebar can be used as well.*

Tiling window managers also offer several different layouts in which to tile
windows. In Arek Window Manager, those are called modes. Currently, Arek Window
Manager supports four of those modes:

* Vertical tiling, your average regular tiling layout (figure 1) (Super+T);
* Horizontal tiling, your average bottom tiling layout (figure 2) (Super+B);
* Monocle, your average fullscreen tiling layout (Super+M);
* Floating, regular stacking window manager behaviour (Super+F).

The vertical and horizontal modes both support any (nonnegative) number of
master windows. Increasing and decreasing the amount of master windows is done
with Super+= and Super+-, respectively. The factor that the master area occupies
on the monitor can also be changed, with Super+[ to decrease the factor and
Super+] to increase it. Furthermore, a window can be swapped with the first
master window via Super+Return.

One can use the usual Super+Tab and Super+Shift+Tab to respectively focus the
next and previous window. Windows in the stack can be moved around with
Super+Control+Tab and Super+Control+Shift+Tab.

Internally, Mutter keeps track of all the windows on all its workspaces. These
lists can be queried per workspace via meta_workspace_list_windows. However,
they are sorted on the stacking order of the windows contained in them. This
order is not suitable for tiling purposes, which requires the list to be sorted
by window's positions (e.g. the first window in the list will be the first
master window). This difference requires Arek Window Manager to maintain its own
list of windows. It does so by maintaining a GList that holds pointers to all
MetaWindows that are currently active and should be managed by Arek Window
Manager. New windows are always prepended to the list, which means they will
always appear in the master area. When windows are moved around on the screen,
internally their position in the list is changed. To quickly find the currently
active window, Arek Window Manager keeps a pointer to this window's position in
the list.

Please come back even later :)

Settings
--------

Arek Window Manager's default behaviour can be changed in its settings. These
can be found at com.unia.wm in dconf-editor. Right now, settings that can be
changed are:

* The default master factor;
* The step at which the master factor is in- or decreased;
* The default amount of master windows;
* The default tile mode.

*Currently, changed settings do not take effect until Arek Window Manager is
restarted.*

Keybindings
-----------

As already shown, Arek Window Manager can be controlled with the keyboard.
Keybindings are set via Mutter's meta_display_add_keybinding function.
They can be configured in com.unia.arek.wm.keybindings. Note that some of
Mutter's keybindings are reused, with a custom handler. For now these are:

* "overlay-key", "panel-main-menu" and "panel-run-dialog" to open Arek Menu;
* "switch-windows", "switch-applications", "switch-windows-backward" and
  "switch-applications-backward" to cycle through the windows on a workspace;

Here's a quick recap of all Arek Window Manager's keybindings:

* Super+T: vertical tiling mode;
* Super+B: horizontal tiling mode;
* Super+M: monocle tiling mode;
* Super+F: float tiling mode;
* Super+Space: toggle the active window between floating and tiled;
* Super+Return: move the active window to the master area;
* Super+Tab: change focus to the next window;
* Super+Shift+Tab: change focus to the previous window;
* Super+Control+Tab: move the active window up in the stack;
* Super+Control+Shift+Tab: move the active window down in the stack;
* Super+=: increment the number of master windows;
* Super+-: decrement the number of master windows;
* Super+[: decrease the master factor;
* Super+]: increase the master factor;
